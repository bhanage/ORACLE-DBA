The multitenant architecture enables an Oracle database to function as a multitenant container database (CDB). 
The multitenant architecture solves several problems posed by the traditional non-CDB architecture. 
A container is logical collection of data or metadata within the multitenant architecture. 
For the duration of its existence, a database is either a CDB or a non-CDB. 
Exactly one CDB root container (also called simply the root)

The CDB root is a collection of schemas, schema objects, and nonschema objects to which all PDBs belong
The system container includes the root CDB and all PDBs in the CDB. Thus, the system container is the logical container for the CDB itself. 

A PDB contains the data and code required for a specific set of features (see "PDBs"). For example, a PDB can support a specific application, 
such as a human resources or sales application. No PDBs exist at creation of the CDB. You add PDBs based on your business requirements. 
A PDB belongs to exactly zero or one application container. If a PDB belongs to an application container, then it is an application PDB.
