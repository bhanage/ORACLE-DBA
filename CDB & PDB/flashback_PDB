RECOVER DELETED PDB using flashback database.
SQL> alter pluggable database <PDBNAME> open; (all)
PDBNAME: dbwr
rman target /
RMAN> backup pluggable database dbwr; <PDB+NAME>
SQL> create restore point work GUARANTEE FLASHBACK DATABASE;
SQL> SELECT NAME, SCN, TO_CHAR(TIME, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS RESTORE_POINT_TIME FROM V$RESTORE_POINT;
SQL> alter pluggable database dbwr close;
SQL> drop pluggable database dbwr unplug into '/path/to/dbwr.xml';
SQL> drop pluggable database including datafiles;
SQL>commit;
Check alert logs 
SQL> startup mount
rman> list restore point all;
rman> flashback database to restore point work;
After running this command you will get original filenames of dbwr pdb are restored at default location with UNNAMED<FILE#> like name note those names.

rman>alter database open resetlogs;

Now, you can see deleted pdb but cannot see datafiles as there original names

rman>shutdown immediate

Rename those files with .dbf and copy to asm if want 
rman>startup mount
sqlplus / as sysdba
SQL> alter database rename file 'file location of UNNAME' to 'New name system.dbf';
Likewise copy all sysaux,undotbs1,users
SQL>alter database open;
now if you try to open the PDB then it shows error as


ORA-01147: SYSTEM tablespace file 61 is offline (61 is file id for system.dbf of pdb)
For that you have to make all tablespaces to online
alter session set container=dbwr;
alter pluggable database dbwr datafile 'system.dbf' online;
alter pluggable database dbwr datafile 'sysaux.dbf' online;
alter pluggable database dbwr datafile 'undotbs1.dbf' online; 
alter pluggable database dbwr datafile 'users.dbf' online;
After that if you try to open database
my be it show error as
ORA-01190: control file or data file 64 is from before the last RESETLOGS
Hence now you need to flashback pdb
SQL> flashback pluggable database dbwr to restore point work;
SQL> alter pluggable database dbwr open resetlogs;
Now, you can see you will open PDB in read,write
