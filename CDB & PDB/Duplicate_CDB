How to duplicate pluggable database using rman from CDB to another CDB.
On Source Machine (target),
Precheck : 
1. CDB(BOTH),PDB(wanted to clone) must be open in read,write.
2. Must be in archive log mode
On Destination Machine(auxiliary),
1. Listener entry for destination machine with tns entry for source,destination machine if both db is with same name only source  machine entry is fine with relevant port number of source.
2.
Steps:
1. Go to the source machine check valid password of sys and create passwd file
as $ORACLE_HOME/dbs -> orapwd file=orapwsky password=Xinudaes#123 force=y 'sys=y'
2.copy this file remotely to destination as 
scp orapwsky oracle@192.168.25.160:$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapwsky(sky is name of dest db if your db name is different then use that one).
3. On Destination Machine,
set password of sys same used in source machine.
4. Make sure listener must be open at both machines.
5.In destination machine, set 
SQL> alter system set remote_recovery_file_dest='/orahome/app/oraInventory/fast_recovery_area';
6.  Connect to rman 
If both dbnames are same.
 rman target=sys/Xinudaes#123@sky auxiliary=sys/Xinudaes#123
If both dbnames are not same
rman target=sys/Xinudaes#123@SOURCEDB auxiliary=sys/Xinudaes#123@DESTDB
RMAN> DUPLICATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdbsky as pdbsky1 to sky from active database nofilenamecheck;
7. VERIFY,
sqlplus / as sysdba
SQL> show pdbs     

    CON_ID CON_NAME			  OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
---------- ------------------------------ ---------- ----------
	 2 PDB$SEED			  READ ONLY  NO
	 3 PDBSKY1			  READ WRITE NO
SQL> alter session set container=pdbsky1;

Session altered.

SQL> select * from user1.customer;

Database is clonned Successfully.
