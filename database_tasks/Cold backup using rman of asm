###COLD BACKUP USING RMAN######
1. Open database in archive mode
2. alter system switch logfile * number of logfiles
3. shut down database and open in mount mode
4. in rman take full backup such as RMAN> backup as compressed backupset database format '/u02/backup/testdb1/%d_%Y%M%D_%s_%p';
5. remote copy those files in the destination check read write permissions
6. set ORACLE Env and SID
7. startup force nomount -> restore spfile -> shutdown immediate
8, startup force nomount -> restore controlfile -> shutdown immediate
9. startup force mount -> check path for list backup of database if it is same as specified in it then no need to change
10. else , It shows erro -> No Autobackup on for spfile and controlfile
RMAN-06509: only SPFILE or control file can be restored from AUTOBACKUP
11. We need to start catalog with file path where we copied backup files remotely
12. catalog start with '/path/to/new_dir/%U' ---> PERMIT AS YES 
13. after that shutdown immediate and startup mount
14. recover database or recover database using backup controlfile;
15. If it still shows error as :
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01113: file 1 needs media recovery
ORA-01110: data file 1: '+DATA/carrot/DATAFILE/system.dbf'

16. shutdown db and go to initsid.ora if it is not created then
17. create pfile from spfile; and then shutdown db
18. In that file add parameter at the end of the file as : _allow_resetlogs_corruption=TRUE
19. startup mount --> recover database; --> alter database open resetlogs;
