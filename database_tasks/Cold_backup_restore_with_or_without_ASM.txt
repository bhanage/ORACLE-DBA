COLD backup using RMAN (EITHER with ASM or WITHOUT ASM)

In cases where DB is running in NOARCHIVELOG mode, You need to execute RMAN backup after bringing the DB in mount mode.

1. Shutdown the database
sqlplus> Shut immediate;

2. startup mount and exit sqlplus prompt
sqlplus> startup mount;

3. rman target /

4. Backup database to default FRA location
RMAN> Backup database;

---OR

4. Backup data to custom location
RMAN> backup database format '/u02/backup/testdb/full_bkp_%U';

5. OPen the database for use
RMAN> alter database open 

--OR

sqlplus> alter database open.


==============================================================
Restore COLDBACKUP taken using RMAN on REMOTE machine with ASM

Configuration
DBNAME: TESTDB1, all files under ASM including SPFILE

1. Database backup taken to custom location with backup set name as using command

RMAN> backup as compressed backupset database format '/u02/backup/testdb1/%d_%Y%M%D_%s_%p';

2. Copy the file to remote machine using scp

3. Challenges on remote machine
--> We only have backup set
--> RMAN backup was based on controlfile config and not on CATALOG config
--> To startup the database we need SPFILE and CONTROLFILE to be recovered first before rest of the recovery can be done.

4. setup environment variables for GRID on remote machine. connect to ASMCMD and create the DBNAME folder

asmcmd> cd data
asmcmd> mkdir testdb1

5. setup environment variables for ORACLE_DB_HOME. We have to start our instance using (startup force nomount)

RMAN> startup force nomount;

PS: this will show errors but thats OK.

6. once the DB is up, restore control file

RMAN> restore spfile from '/tmp/TESTDB1_20240209_2_1';

7. once SPFILE is restored, shutdown the instance and start using SPFILE

RMAN> Shut immediate;
RMAN> startup force nomount;

8. Now restore controlfile
RMAN> restore controlfile from '/tmp/TESTDB1_20240209_2_1';

9. now with controlfiles restored, stop db, startdb with SPFILE and CONTROLFILE.

RMAN> Shut immediate;
RMAN> startup force mount;

10. Now as the DB is up with original controlfile, 
this file has the backup information available internally.
so we can directly say restore database if the restored data is in the same path as BACKUP-PATH
else we have to say restore database from RESTORE-PATH

(10A)     If you have restored the backupset in same location as backup location
RMAN> restore database;

(10B) If have restored the backupset in different location

RMAN> restore database from '/tmp/TESTDB1_20240209_2_1';


11. open the database
RMAN> alter database open;
